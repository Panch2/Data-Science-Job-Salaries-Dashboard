Summary of Data Science Salaries Dashboard in Tableau 📊

In this project, I crafted a comprehensive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze data science job salaries. The dashboard is designed to provide insightful and interactive views into how salaries vary based on location, experience level, employment type, and job role. Here's a detailed summary of the visualizations and components I included in the dashboard:

Steps Taken:

Data Preparation 🛠️: I collected and preprocessed the data to ensure it was clean and well-structured for visualization in Tableau.
Creating Donut Charts 🍩: I designed these charts to provide an intuitive breakdown of job distributions by employment type, experience level, and company size/location.

Designing the Bar Chart 📊: I developed this bar chart to highlight the top 10 locations for employee residency, making it easy to identify where data science professionals are predominantly located.

Developing Circle Views 🔵: I chose circle views to illustrate the average salary by experience level and employment type due to their effectiveness in showing relative comparisons.

Building the Map Visualization 🗺️: I created the map to offer a clear visual representation of how salaries vary across different countries, making geographical patterns easily recognizable.
Constructing the Text Table 📋: I designed the text table to provide detailed salary information by job title and experience level, offering a granular view of salary data.

Conclusion:

The Tableau dashboard I created delivers a detailed and interactive way to explore data science job salaries. By incorporating various visualizations, the dashboard enables users to easily understand how salaries differ based on factors such as location, experience level, employment type, and job role. This comprehensive approach ensures that users can derive meaningful insights from the data, facilitating informed decision-making and in-depth analysis regarding data science job salaries.
